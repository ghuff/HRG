Tests 1 and 2 were performed with a pixel 1->4 vector averaging. Test2 had an erode function performed on the pixels to create smaller black marks for the pixel.

Test3 was performed with a pixel 1->4 averaging and pixel 2->3 averaging.

test5 was performed 170mm with kinect up in y direction to be more co-planar with elements.
test6 moved kinect back 560mm.
